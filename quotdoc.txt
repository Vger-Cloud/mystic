Under the wide an starry sky,
Dig my grave and let me lie,
Glad did I live and gladly die,
And laid me down with a will,
And this be the verse that you grave for me,
Here he lies where he longed to be,
Home is the sailor home from the sea,
And the hunter home from the hill.
                -- R. Kipling

I never took acid. I smoked grass and tripped on it, but I never took
acid. I was afraid to take it. The song's about a girl who hasn't
decided whether she wants to stay with me or not. It's pretty much one
of those love songs.

back at him.

I was asked to Interview at JPL once for a short term immediate need
contract to address some infrastucture issues back in the NT 4.0 days. 

The interview itself went well between me and three staff members, and
at the end they gave me a quick tour of the facilities I would be
managing. I figured I would be receiving a call in the next day or two,
but before I left, they led me to a room with some workstations and
asked me to take a test.

I declined.

Less than a month later, two of those interviewers in the group were
among the students attending a Core Technologies class I was teaching
in the MCSE program.

When you boil the water, you really should just make the damn coffee.

OMV does not contain ANY (0%) code from FreeNAS. I did implement
everything from beginning. Nevertheless, the most code from FreeNAS has
been done by myself at the end. Show me any piece of code you think it
is from FreeNAS. Please do not shout out lies if you talk about
something you did not know.

back.”

I'll paraphrase a statement I made on IRC a moment ago:

You can break a system with slackroll, with swaret, with slapt-get, with slackpkg, and yes, even doing it "by hand" or "manually" or whatever you want to call it. In all but a small minority of cases, the tool is not to blame - it's user error, even if that error was failing to read and/or understand the documentation on how to use the tool properly.

Ultimately, shit will happen. It also happens to fly farther when using tools.
